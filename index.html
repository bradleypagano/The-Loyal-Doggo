        The dog is man's best friend.  I mean, look at this cute little pupper.  How could you not love that face?
        This doggo is so cute!  Dogs are just the cutest friggin animals on the entire planet.  You're basically souless if you don't agree.

        The dog is loyal.  If you develop a bond with a dog, they will hold on to that bond forever.  You could go a year without seeing each other
        and the dog will still go nuts when they see you again.  It's kinda the best.

        The dog is playful.  This attribute helps their humans blow off stress and decrompress after a shitty day in this shitty world.  Dogs are there to
        lift you back up.  They remind people that something is still pure in this world of suffering.
